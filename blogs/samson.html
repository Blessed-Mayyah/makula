    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><em>MY EXPERIENCE IN INTRODUCTION TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CLASS.</em></h1>
        <p>The class began with an exploration of the inner workings of the internet—a vast network of interconnected computers spanning the globe. 
        I was fascinated to learn about the underlying protocols and technologies that enable communication and data exchange across the internet, 
      from the Domain Name System (DNS) to the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Understanding these foundational concepts 
      provided me with a newfound appreciation for the complexity and sophistication of the digital infrastructure that powers our modern world.
      <br>
      From the beginning of the second week, I was captivated by the power and versatility of HTML, the backbone of every web page.
      Learning to structure content, create forms, and embed media felt like unlocking the building blocks of the internet.
      As we delved deeper into CSS, I was blown away by the endless possibilities for styling and customizing the look and feel of web pages. 
       From adjusting fonts and colors to creating responsive layouts, CSS opened up a world of creativity and expression. With each new concept mastered, I felt more confident in my ability to bring my design ideas to life.
    <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The class had an introduction to Git, a powerful version control system that revolutionizes the way developers collaborate on projects. 
      I was captivated by the simplicity and efficiency of Git, as I learned how to create repositories, track changes, and collaborate with teammates seamlessly. The concept of branching and merging opened up new possibilities for collaboration, allowing me to experiment with different features and ideas without fear of disrupting the main codebase.
      
      As we delved deeper into Git in the cloud, I was introduced to platforms such as GitHub and GitLab, which serve as central repositories for hosting and managing Git projects.
      Learning how to push and pull code, create pull requests, and manage issues and milestones on these platforms was both enlightening and empowering. I gained a newfound appreciation for the role of version control in software development, as I realized the importance of maintaining a clean and organized codebase.
      Furthermore, I was introduced to grid systems, which provide a flexible and efficient way to organize content on web pages.
      Learning about the concept of grids, columns, and breakpoints was eye-opening, as I discovered how to create responsive layouts that adapt 
      to the unique needs of each user. The ability to design fluid and adaptive websites using grid systems was empowering, as I realized the potential to create immersive and engaging user experiences.
      In addition to mastering Git, the class also provided an introduction to Bootstrap—a popular front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites. 
      I was amazed by the versatility and convenience of Bootstrap, as I learned how to leverage its pre-designed components and grid system to create beautiful and functional web layouts with ease. The concept of responsive design, which allows websites to adapt to different screen sizes and devices,
      was particularly intriguing, as I realized the importance of delivering a seamless user experience across all platforms.
      <br>
      Looking back on my two weeks of learning HTML, CSS, Git and Bootstrap, I am filled with a sense of accomplishment and excitement for the journey ahead. Armed with the skills and knowledge gained in this class, I feel empowered to tackle new challenges, explore new possibilities, and continue honing my craft as a web developer. 
      The past two weeks have been just the beginning of what I know will be an exciting and fulfilling journey into the world of web development.
